Before hook. Runs the first match, if it exists.

- upgrade:web:before
- upgrade:before

Primary task. Runs the first match, if it exists.

- upgrade:web:<context>
- upgrade:web

- upgrade:web:<context>:after
- upgrade:web:after

If xtask cannot find target with the app name, it will then search
for other xtaskfiles using the app name if the config.dirs.apps section
in the current xtaskfile is set.

If the app name is the same as the last folder in the path.

./src/web

if it will first for the following in order...

./src/web/[CONTEXT]/xtaskfile
./src/web/xtaskfile

If the app name is not the same as the last folder in the path e.g.

./src

Then it will search for...

./src/[APP]/[CONTEXT]/xtaskfile
./src/[APP]/xtaskfile

If no context is provided, it will use "default" as the context.

You can override the context by setting the XTASK_CONTEXT environment
variable or using the --context, -c flag.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// upgradeCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// upgradeCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
